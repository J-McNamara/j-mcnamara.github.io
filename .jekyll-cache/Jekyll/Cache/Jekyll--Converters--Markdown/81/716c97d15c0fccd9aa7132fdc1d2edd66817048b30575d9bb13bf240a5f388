I"E<p>A few quotes on science I’ve read or heard in lectures.</p>

<hr />

<p><br />
A good idea is like a good joke. They both have a spark. They make a connection. They require a certain suspension of one’s conventional thinking […] and I think it also requires a playfulness to have good ideas.<br />
- Jeremy Nathans, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWOjewh_6QQ">Creativity in Science</a></p>

<p><br />
“Cell biologists look; geneticists count; biochemists clean,” the scientist Arthur Kornberg once said. […] Watson and Crick played. They worked methodically, diligently, and carefully— but left enough room for their key strength: lightness. If they were to win this race, it would be through whimsy and intuition; they would laugh their way to DNA.<br />
- Siddhartha Mukherjee, <em>The Gene</em></p>

<p><br />
To have one experiment that works, and keep doing it all the time.<br />
- Alfred Hershey, describing scientific happiness (“Hershey heaven”)</p>

<p><br />
<em>kT</em> giveth, and <em>kT</em> taketh away.<br />
- Harry Noller, lecture at JHMI</p>
