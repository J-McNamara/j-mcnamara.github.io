A few quotes on science I've read or heard in lectures.

---

\
A good idea is like a good joke. They both have a spark. They make a connection. They require a certain suspension of one's conventional thinking [...] and I think it also requires a playfulness to have good ideas.  
\- Jeremy Nathans, [Creativity in Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWOjewh_6QQ)

\
"Cell biologists look; geneticists count; biochemists clean,” the scientist Arthur Kornberg once said. [...] Watson and Crick played. They worked methodically, diligently, and carefully— but left enough room for their key strength: lightness. If they were to win this race, it would be through whimsy and intuition; they would laugh their way to DNA.  
\- Siddhartha Mukherjee, *The Gene*

\
To have one experiment that works, and keep doing it all the time.  
\- Alfred Hershey, describing scientific happiness ("Hershey heaven")

\
*kT* giveth, and *kT* taketh away.  
\- Harry Noller, lecture at JHMI
