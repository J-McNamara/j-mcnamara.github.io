### Notes pro
- Re-discovery of the same compounds by different assays
- Antibiotics stop
- Cost increases, total
- Fewer INDs
- Fewer lives saved per drug
- Lifespan is levelling or retreating 
- More research bureaucracy red tape
- Growth of regulatory apparatus
- Approaching asymptote for infant mortality
- Vaccines? Better or worse.



### Notes contra
- Platform technologies 
	+ Sequencing 
	+ DNA synthesis
	+ Vectors
	+ Editing
	+ Gene therapy
	+ Cell therapy
	+ Antibodies
	+ Combinatorial chemistry
	+ Screening tech (CRISPR)
	+ Vaccines
	+ mRNA
	+ High throughput phenotypic screening
	+ 

# Running out of steam?
- Lifespan
- Infant mortality 

# QOL - Work to do
- Acne
- Myopia
- Blindness
- Rare diseases

# Drug discovery is a search or a search of searches
- Look where someone has already enriched:
	+ Bacteria
	+ Chemicals?
	+ Immune system
	+ CRISPR
	+ Viruses / phage
	+
