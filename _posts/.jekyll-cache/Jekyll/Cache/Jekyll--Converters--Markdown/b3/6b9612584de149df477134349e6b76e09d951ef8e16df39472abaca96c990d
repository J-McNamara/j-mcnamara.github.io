<h3 id="yeast-as-an-aging-model">Yeast as an aging model</h3>
<p>Budding yeast are perhaps the simplest organism one can grow in the laboratory that ages. Thier cell division is asymmetric, with a “mother” cell producing a smaller “bud” at each cycle. Each newborn bud then lives out a lifespan of ~25 cell divisions as a mother, producing more buds. At the end of this “replicative lifespan” mother cells wrinkle up, stop reproducing, and die. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>As such, people have used it as a model to try and figure out what goes wrong in cells as they age that causes them to stop dividing and die.</p>

<p>And some people have proposed x. This violates my <a href="/the-thing">Law of Doing The Thing</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reasons-to-make-an-immortal-yeast-cell">Reasons to make an immortal yeast cell</h3>
<p>The propositions - and I have considered a few are usually that</p>

<h3 id="we-already-have-immortal-yeast">We already have immortal yeast</h3>
<p>One way to think about this is to consider that we already have yeast cells that don’t age. As I mentioned, <em>budding</em> yeast are used as an aging model, but another lab organism, <em>fission</em> yeast, are not. This is because they divide by symmetric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_(biology)">binary fission</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of working from an aging yeast towards an immortal yeast to figure out what went wrong, lets work from the immortal cells to the aging ones.</p>

<p>How do these things live forever? A nice <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/20340" target="_blank">study</a> from a few years ago did a convincing job confirming what most people suspected - these cells, which divide symetrically, do not age. This is not to say that they are immortal, but that thier chances of dying do not increase with time.
One feature of aging is <a href="">Gompertzian</a> mortality. This means that the probability of death at any particular moment increases with time. An 80 year old is more likely to die on any given Tuesday than an 8 year old.</p>

<p>This increase in the <strong>hazard rate</strong> with time is not observed in several symmetrically dividing organisms.</p>

<p>They grab on to one end of the yeast cell and x:

<p>That gives you a mortality curve that looks like this:

<p>They have a finite lifespan and die eventually, but the chances of dying do not increase with the number of cell divisions.</p>

<p>The same is true of <img src="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/5/eaaw2069" alt="*E. coli*" />?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, in a way</li>
  <li>Model systems are cowardly</li>
  <li>Let me tinker with yeast for 30 years - I have fallen to this</li>
  <li>Genes and homology are conserved, but multiparameters are not conserved</li>
  <li>Limiting</li>
