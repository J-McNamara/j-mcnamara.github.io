A running list of questions that occur to me. I often ask questions on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Josh-McNamara/questions) as well.

##### Aging
- Why aren't longevity mutations discovered in mutagenesis screens extant in wild-type populations?
- Do diseases of aging share common causes?
	+ Should we continue to address them on a disease-by-disease basis?
- Why can't age-associated aggregates like drusen, lipofuscin, amyloid, Lewy bodies, and glycation be degraded?
- Why don't artificial hearts last forever?
- Which interventions currently reduce all-cause mortality?
- Does evolutionary theory contradict some of the most popular theories of the cause of aging? (Read [Michael Rose](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5261) for an aging Theory of Everything.)

##### Misc. Biology
- Why are mammalian sex ratios roughly equal?
- How do cells adjust to cold shocks?
- How does karyotypic speciation happen in sexual organisms, given that their karyotype must be compatible with a mate's?
- Is x-chromosome inactivation reversible?
- What determines the reversibility of mitotic exit?
- How much information is in a cell?
- Does [Muller's ratchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muller%27s_ratchet) make sense?
- How does biomineral morphogenesis (growth of bones, diatoms, etc.) work?

### Research institutions and culture
- How useful is basic biology research?
- How useful are research exercises, vs just working on a real problem?
- Which tools can I use to enhance my thinking?
- Should researchers be teachers?
- How can we improve scientific education?
- Can bureaucracies make discoveries?
- How much of institutional excellence is feedback from good recruiting?
- Does earmarking research grants increase or decrease capital efficiency?


### Healthcare business and economics
- Is the pace of drug discovery stagnating (a.k.a. [Eroom's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroom%27s_law))?
- Is the pace of medical innovation stagnating?
- How should we interpret the [RAND Health Insurance Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Health_Insurance_Experiment)?
- Why isn't it profitable to develop new antibiotics?
- Are American insulin prices a scam?

- Should we donate our electronic medical records to the public upon dying?
- How does cash payment for treatments influence affordability and innovation in medicine?
- Are patent protections for biologic drugs useful to society?
- What kinds of medical innovations can be successful when intellectual property and regulatory protections are weak?
- Why are successful biotech venture capital firms adapting a "venture creation" model, where ventures are started in-house?
- Are discovery-phase research programs at large pharmaceutical companies productive?
- What are the biggest secular trends in healthcare / biotech / pharma? 
- Would it be useful to be able to bet directly on the outcome of clinical trials without trading a company's shares?
- What are the pros and cons of medical tourism?
- Are insurance co-pays useful?
- Are data-centric biotech companies ever going to make any money?
- Are there any good opportunities for veterinary-human crossover drug discovery?

### Computer science
- What is the minimum number of dimensions necessary to implement a universal classical computer?
- Are computational kinetics provable? (i.e. can we determine analytically which processes cannot be computed faster on an alternative architectures without having to simulate them?)
- Will homeomorphic encryption become practical anytime soon?
- How probabilistic is software debugging? How much of it can be automated?
- What are the potential uses of evolutionary algorithms?
- Can more computation be [memoized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) than we think?

### Chemistry
- Do microwaves have any non-thermal effects on reaction kinetics?
- How useful is light in imparting enantioselectivity?
- How well can organisms discriminate isotopes?
- Would ice polymorphs with densities close to water allow us to freeze tissues without cryoprotectants?

### Physics
- Can the reverse of a microwave oven exist? I.e. "stimulated radiative cooling".

##### Thermodynamics
- Can some formal expression describe the minimal energetic costs of molecular quality control?
- How does Shannon entropy relate to Boltzmann entropy? (I read [answers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory) to this one once in a while, but I don't really get it yet. It seems like the most important and fundamental bit of science that I never encountered in school.)
- Can we measure the information content of matter through calorimetry?
	* _Thought experiment_: I have one hard drive filled with random data and another that has 1s and 0s in strict alternation. I put them both in a perfect bomb calorimeter. Do they evolve different amounts of heat? 

### Economics
