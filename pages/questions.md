A running list of questions and links to my attempts to answer them.

### Medicine and drug discovery
- Would use of additional dyes in routine histology improve its diagnostic capacity?
- Can acne be treated with [phage](https://mcnamara.website/phage)?
- Can we infer pairs of bacteria and phage that kill each other from their covariation in [metagenomic](https://mcnamara.website/metagenomics) sequencing experiments?
- Why do people have [allergies](https://mcnamara.website/allergies) to the same things?
- Why is [Myopia](https://mcnamara.website/myopia) on the rise, and what can we do about it? 
- What causes [atherosclerosis](https://mcnamara.website/atherosclerosis), the leading killler of humans globally?
- Are parasite-derived [immunosuppressants](https://mcnamara.website/immunosuppressants) useful as therapeutics?
- Can T cell and B cell [receptor repertoire sequencing](https://mcnamara.website/immunoseq) serve as a "universal diagnostic" and enable the discovery of new drug targets? 

### Healthcare economics
- Are hospital stay reimbursement caps a significant obstacle to antibiotic development?
- Are American insulin prices a scam?
- How can we use electronic medical records to improve patient care and accelerate drug discovery?
- Should we donate our electronic medical records to the public upon dying?
- How does cash payment influence affordability and innovation in medicine?
- Are patent protections for biologic drugs useful?
- What kinds of medical innovations are profitable when intellectual property protections are weak?
- Why are successful biotech venture capital firms adapting a "venture creation" model, where ventures are started in-house?

### Computer science
- What is the minimum number of dimensions necessary to implement a universal classical computer?
- How does Shannon entropy relate to Boltzmann entropy?
- Can we measure the information content of matter through calorimetry?

### Chemistry
- Do microwaves have any non-thermal effects on reaction kinetics?

### Energy
